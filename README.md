Arrays and Looping Independent Project

This webpage is my Independent Project for Epicodus evening Intro to Programming course. (3/10/2017)

By Andrew Dalton, Epicodus, Bootstrap, JQuery-3.1.1

Description

This webpage allows the user to play a little numbers game called Ping-Pong, where they input a number and the page returns their number along with any numbers that are less than that number. If they input a number divisible by 3, Ping is returned. If they input a number divisible by 5, Pong is returned. If they input a number that is divisible by 15 (or both 3 and 5), it will return PingPong.
